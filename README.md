# How to use

1. Copy mingen.py into your website's main folder.
2. Make a folder 'items' and make:
- _nav.md_ file which will appear at the top of all pages
- _footer.md_ file which will appear at the bottom of all pages
- _head.html_ file which be added in the `<head></head>` of the html page

All markdown files will be converted to html files.

The first line will be used as the title and heading.

Name your files starting with the date of creation in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md (ex. 2022-05-15-test-post.md) to sort by creation date.
